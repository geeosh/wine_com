= Introduction 

WineCom provides a simple no-frills interface to the Wine.com query API.
  
Its purpose is to eliminate the code duplication in setting up the request each time
you which to receive information from the API.

It returns pure JSON or XML depending on which type of response you request.

= Installation

To install, run:

  $ sudo gem install wine_dot_com_api_request

Then, place your API key from wine.com in the lib/wine_dot_com_api_request/configuration.rb file.

= Examples

To perform a request, follow the example below:

  w = WineDotComApiRequest.new(:search => 'mondavi cabernet',
                               :format => :xml,
                               :resource => :catalog,
                               :size => 1,
                               :offset => 0)

  res = w.query

View the documentation for possible search arguments.

The query routine will return either the raw XML or JSON request, depending on which you specify.
